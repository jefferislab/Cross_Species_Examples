# Preface
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

What you will see in the rest of the document is a mixture of text and R code
along with the visualisations and analysis produced from that code. You can 
compile the whole document to an HTML document by hitting **Knit HTML** in 
RStudio. You can also explore what is happening by running code interactively 
line by line in an R console.

# Setup
## Installation
Before running this script, you need to install packages. It's a good idea to do
this from an interactive R session in case of any problems. This code block will
not be run when you click Knit HTML, but you can copy paste into your RStudio or
other R terminal.

```{r install, eval=F}
# install standard package from CRAN
install.packages(c("nat.nblast","stringr","dendroextras","knitr"))

# install catmaid package from github with devtools
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jefferis/rcatmaid")
```



## Load packages
First let's do some basic setup, loading the necessary R packages.
```{r setup, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(catmaid)
library(nat.nblast)
library(stringr)
library(dendroextras)
library(knitr)

# so that we can make snapshots of 3d plots or include interactive 3d
knit_hooks$set(rgl=hook_rgl, webgl=hook_webgl)
```

# Data
## Load Data
Now let's fetch the neuron data along with the brain surface model

```{r data, cache=FALSE, results='hide'}
# neurons
bgc=readRDS("BasinGoroCells.rds")

# surface mesh
l1surf=readRDS("l1surf.rds")
l1mesh=readRDS("l1mesh.rds")
```


Let's make some metadata including establishing the side of brain, storing this
as an extra column in the attached data.frame
```{r metadata}
# fix data.frames
bgc[,'side']=str_match(str_match(bgc[,'name'],'[at][1-9][lr]|[LRlr]$'), "[LRlr]")
bgc[,'side']=factor(toupper(bgc[,'side']))
```

## Basic plot of data
Let's make a plot where we just colour neurons by side of brain (as determined by 
soma location).
```{r prelim plot3d, rgl=TRUE}
# nb don't plot synapses (WithConne=F) and do plot somata (r=2000 nm)
clear3d();plot3d(bgc, col=side, WithConne=F,soma=2000)
view3d(270,-90, fov=0, zoom=.65)
```

# NBLAST

We're going to try using NBLAST with these data. We need to convert them to 
the `dotprops` format. We convert the neurons from nanometre to micron spatial
units and resample every 1 Âµm.

```{r, results='hide', cache=TRUE}
# convert from nm to microns 
bgc.dps=dotprops(bgc/1000, resample=1, .progress='text')
```

We'll compute all by all nblast scores and use them for clustering.
```{r nblast all by all}
bgsmat=nblast_allbyall(bgc.dps)
bghc=nhclust(scoremat = bgsmat)
plot(bghc)

# make a copy and label with name rather than skid
bghc2=bghc
bghc2$labels=with(bgc, name)
# cut the 
bghcd=colour_clusters(bghc2, h=2)
par(mar=c(8,4,4,2))
plot(bghcd)
```

```{r plot3d by cluster, rgl=TRUE}
open3d();wire3d(l1mesh, col='grey', size=.1)
view3d(270,-90, fov=0, zoom=.65)
plot3d(bghc, db=bgc, h=2, WithC=F, soma=2e3)
```

Try plotting with points rather than mesh and output as interactive webgl canvas:

```{r, webgl=TRUE}
open3d();points3d(l1surf, col='grey', size=.1)
plot3d(bghc, db=bgc, h=2, WithC=F, soma=2e3)
view3d(270, 0)
```
