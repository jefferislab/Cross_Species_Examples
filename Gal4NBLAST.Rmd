# Preface
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents.
For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

What you will see in the rest of the document is a mixture of text and R code along with the visualisations and analysis produced from that code.
You can compile the whole document to an HTML document by hitting **Knit HTML** in RStudio.
You can also explore what is happening by running code interactively line by line in an R console.

# Setup
## Installation
Before running this script, you need to install packages.
It's a good idea to do this from an interactive R session in case of any problems.
This code block will not be run when you click Knit HTML, but you can copy paste into your RStudio or other R terminal.

```{r install, eval=F}
# install standard package from CRAN
if(!require('nat.nblast')) install.packages("nat.nblast")
if(!require('stringr')) install.packages("stringr")
if(!require('devtools')) install.packages("devtools")
if(!require('flycircuit')) devtools::install_github("jefferis/flycircuit")
if(!require('vfbr')) devtools::install_github("jefferis/vfbr")
```

## Load packages
First let's do some basic setup, loading the necessary R packages.
```{r setup, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(nat)
library(flycircuit)
library(knitr)
library(vfbr)
# so that we can make snapshots of 3d plots or include interactive 3d
knit_hooks$set(rgl=hook_rgl, webgl=hook_webgl)
```

# Data
## Define functions
```{r}

```


## Load Data
Now let's use the flycircuit package to fetch the pre-computed search data from
the flybrain server.

```{r data, cache=FALSE, results='hide'}
scall.sampled=load_si_data('scall.sampled.rds')
```

# NBLAST
## mAL neurons

These neurons are also called aDT1 or aDT-b neurons. We are only going to look
for female neurons since the GMR GAL4 lines were imaged in females.
```{r nblast mAL neurons}
mal=fc_gene_name(subset(annotation, grepl("aDT-b.*female", text))$neuron_idid)
# pick 20
set.seed(1)
mal20=sample(mal, 20)
```

We could look at these neurons by going to this url:

```{r}
library(vfbr)
mal20.vfbids=vfb_tovfbids(fc_neuron(mal20))
vfb_3dbrowser_url(mal20.vfbids)
```

Now let's collect the results for these mAL neurons. We'll get the top 10 Gal4 
lines for each of the 20 neurons and then pick the lines with the most representation.

```{r}
library(stringr)
mal20.sc=lapply(mal20, function(x) sort(scall.sampled[,x],decreasing = TRUE)[1:10])
mal20.top10s=unlist(lapply(mal20.sc, names))
hits=sort(table(str_extract(mal20.top10s, "[0-9]{2}[A-H][0-9]{2}")), decreasing = TRUE)
hits
```

Now we can open those lines in the stack browser as follows:

```{r}
top5=names(hits[1:5])
top5
gmrhits.vfbids=vfb_tovfbids(paste0("GMR_",top5,"*"), fixed = FALSE)
# pick 5 gmr lines and 5 query neurons
u=vfb_stack_url(c(gmrhits.vfbids, mal20.vfbids[1:5]))
u
```

and open that url from R

```{r, eval=FALSE}
browseURL(u)
```
