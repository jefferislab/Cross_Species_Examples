# Preface
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents.
For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

What you will see in the rest of the document is a mixture of text and R code along with the visualisations and analysis produced from that code.
You can compile the whole document to an HTML document by hitting **Knit HTML** in RStudio.
You can also explore what is happening by running code interactively line by line in an R console.

# Setup
## Installation
Before running this script, you need to install packages.
It's a good idea to do this from an interactive R session in case of any problems.
This code block will not be run when you click Knit HTML, but you can copy paste into your RStudio or other R terminal.

```{r install, eval=F}
# install standard package from CRAN
if(!require('nat.nblast')) install.packages("nat.nblast")
if(!require('rvest')) install.packages("rvest")
if(!require('knitr')) install.packages("knitr")
if(!require('stringr')) install.packages("stringr")
if(!require('dendextend')) install.packages("dendextend")
```

## Load packages
First let's do some basic setup, loading the necessary R packages.
```{r setup, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(nat)
library(nat.nblast)
library(stringr)
library(dendextend)
library(knitr)

# so that we can make snapshots of 3d plots or include interactive 3d
knit_hooks$set(rgl=hook_rgl, webgl=hook_webgl)
```

# Data
## Define functions
We need to define a function to read neurons from the insect brain db website

```{r read.tedore.neuron}
#' read a neuron from the insectbraindb/tedore.net site
#' @param x Either a neuron number or a full url to the summary page of a neuron
#' @param baseurl base url for the insectbraindb website
#' @param ... additional arguments passed to read.neuron
#' @examples
#' nn=read.neurons()
read.tedore.neuron<-function(x, baseurl="http://www.tedore.net/", ...) {
  # complete url for input spec if required
  if(is.character(x) && substr(x,1,4)=="NIN-") {
   x=as.numeric(substr(x, 5, nchar(x)))
  }
  if(is.numeric(x)){
    nid=x
    x=file.path(file.path(baseurl,"neurons"),x,"")
  } else {
    # the numeric id for the neuron should be the last part of url
    nid=basename(x)
  }

  # get all possible html nodes
  h=read_html(x)
  nn=rvest::html_nodes(h,'.dl-horizontal')

  # subset node with 3d model info
  n3d=grepl("3-D model",rvest::html_text(nn) )
  if(!any(n3d))
    stop("No 3d model available")

  # now find url for the 3d model
  n=nn[[which(n3d)]]
  url=rvest::html_attr(rvest::html_nodes(n,'a'),'href')
  url=file.path(baseurl, url)
  if(!length(url)) {
    # hmm that didn't work, let's look at all the nodes
    nt=rvest::html_text(rvest::html_nodes(n, "dd, dt"))
    model_node=grep("3-D model", nt)
    filename=nt[model_node+1]
    if(length(filename)) url=file.path(baseurl,"media/neurons",nid,"reconstruction", filename)
  }
  if(!length(url))
    stop("Unable to find unique url for 3d neuron model")
  
  nat::read.neuron(url, ...)
}
```


## Load Data
Now let's use that function to fetch the neuron data.
We'll start by making a table containing information about all the neurons.

```{r data, cache=TRUE, results='hide'}
library(rvest)
# table of information about available neurons
neurons_table=html_table(read_html("http://www.tedore.net/neurons/"), header=T)[[1]]
# tidy up column / row names for R
names(neurons_table)=make.names(names(neurons_table))
rownames(neurons_table)=neurons_table$Identification.Number

message("Downloading ", nrow(neurons_table), " neurons")
suppressWarnings(tedoren <- nlapply(neurons_table$Identification.Number, read.tedore.neuron, OmitFailures=F))
names(tedoren)=neurons_table$Identification.Number

# attach data.frame to neuronlist object...
data.frame(tedoren)=neurons_table

# then keep only good neurons / metadata
actual_neurons=sapply(tedoren, is.neuron)
message("Keeping ", sum(actual_neurons)," valid neurons!")
tedoren=tedoren[actual_neurons]

# make species a factor (since there are only a few distinct values)
tedoren[,'Species']=factor(tedoren[,'Species'])
```

Now let's fetch the surface model.
Options to read the wavefront obj format in which this is encoded have only recently become available.

```{r surface model, cache=TRUE}
# newest versions of rgl package can read wavefront obj files.
if(exists("readOBJ", 'package:rgl')){
  if(!file.exists('monarch_brain_optimized_hh1SWlD.obj'))
    download.file("http://www.tedore.net/media/brain-models/5/monarch_brain_optimized_hh1SWlD.obj", 
                  destfile = 'monarch_brain_optimized_hh1SWlD.obj')
  monarch_cc.surf=rgl::readOBJ("monarch_brain_optimized_hh1SWlD.obj")
} else {
  # get a cached copy from flybrain website
  download.file("http://flybrain.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/si/nblast/nat.examples/07-insectbraindb/monarch_cc.rds", "monarch_cc.rds")
  monarch_cc.surf=readRDS("monarch_cc.rds")
}
```

## Basic plot of data
Let's make a plot where we just colour neurons by side of brain (as determined by soma location).
```{r prelim plot3d, rgl=TRUE}
clear3d()
# nb plot slightly thicker lines and use a radius of 5 µm for the soma
plot3d(subset(tedoren, Species=="Danaus plexippus"), lwd=2, soma=5)
view3d(0,-90, fov=0, zoom=.65)
```

# NBLAST
```{r nblast}
# subset neuronlist down to the Monarch neurons
dpn=subset(tedoren, Species=="Danaus plexippus")
dpn[,'side']=ifelse(grepl("(right|R[0-9]+)", dpn[,'Detail.Page']),"R","L")

# convert to dotprops representation for nblast
# resample every 5µm since these neurons are big, also use 5 nearest neighbours to compute tangent vectors
message("converting neurons to dotprops for nblast")
dpn2=dotprops(dpn, resample=5, k=5)
dpn2=dpn2/5

message("calculating all by all nblast scores for these neurons")
aba=nblast_allbyall(dpn2)
```

```{r clustering}
# plot our clustering
# note use of the Neuron name as a label 
# (fetched from the data.frame attached to dpn neuronlist)
# Looks like sensible relationships between neurons with similar names
hcdn=nhclust(scoremat=aba)
plot(hcdn, labels=with(dpn, Neuron ))
plot(hcdn, labels=with(dpn, paste(Neuron, side)))
plot(hcdn, labels=with(dpn, Detail.Page ))
hcdn.dend=color_branches(hcdn, k=5, col=rainbow)
# nb it is necessary to permute the labels used for assignment so that they are
# in dendrogram order 
dendextend::labels(hcdn.dend)=dpn[labels(hcdn.dend),'Detail.Page']

par(mar=c(8,5,5,2))
plot(hcdn.dend)
```

```{r clustering-3d, rgl=TRUE}
clear3d()
plot3d(hcdn, db=dpn, k=5, soma=5)
```

```{r mirroring}
# TODO
# Develop a mapping of left to right for this brain region, likely based on this
# http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.23054/abstract
# to better compare neurons on left and right side of brain.

# OK, let's try with monarch_cc.surf
# Stanley Heinze says that CX, LX, and AOTU are based on the average template

# here we have a simple affine transform computerd by surface registration in
# Amira between the original surface and a mirror flipped version
m=structure(c(0.999891, 0.00954086, 0.0112588, 0, -0.00955665, 
            0.999953, 0.00134745, 0, -0.0112458, -0.00145435, 0.999935, 0, 
            3.36369, 0.210229, -0.0921294, 1), .Dim = c(4L, 4L))
# Now combine that with a mirror flip 
mm=m%*%scaleMatrix(-1,1,1)

# apply the mirroring to all neurons marked as on the right
# i.e. mapping everyone onto the left
dpnm=nat::xform(dpn, reg=mm, subset=dpn[,'side']=="R")
# and also to the dotprops versions of the neurons
dpn2m=nat::xform(dpn2, reg=mm, subset=dpn2[,'side']=="R")
message("calculating all by all nblast scores for all neurons mapped to left")
abam=nblast_allbyall(dpn2m)
```

```{r mirror-clustering, rgl=TRUE}
hcdnm=nhclust(scoremat=abam)

plot(hcdnm, labels=with(dpn, paste(Neuron, side)))

# now, let's colour the clusters
hcdnm.dend=color_branches(hcdnm, k=5, col=rainbow)
dendextend::labels(hcdnm.dend)=dpn[labels(hcdnm.dend),'Detail.Page']
par(mar=c(8,5,5,2))
plot(hcdnm.dend)
clear3d()
plot3d(hcdnm, db=dpn, k=5, soma=8, lwd=2)
wire3d(monarch_cc.surf, col='grey', lwd=0.3)

# and plotting mirrored neurons, rather than originals
clear3d()
plot3d(hcdnm, db=dpnm, k=5, soma=8, lwd=2)
wire3d(monarch_cc.surf, col='grey', lwd=0.3)

# Now let's compare the clustering with and without mirroring
tanglegram(hcdn.dend, hcdnm.dend, margin_inner=10)
```

Looking closely, we can see some differences and similarities. First the  similarities:

1. dp-TuLAL.* are all in the same position
2. TL2a and TL2b alteranate properly, left then right. Furtheremore TL4 now joins them
3. TU-pdl alternate left/right and are all together

Now the main thing that needs attention is groups 2 and 4.

```{r group4, rgl=TRUE}
clear3d()
plot3d(hcdnm, db=dpn, k=5, soma=8, lwd=2,groups=c(2,4))
```

Group 4 now consists of a pair of CPU1b neurons.
These clearly belong together the only question is whether they should be tagged as left or right. 
They are tagged as left, presumably since they have dendritic and axonal processes on the right.
However they have their somata on the left as far as I can see, so it seems that their projections are all contralateral.

Now finally let's review group 2:
```{r group2, rgl=TRUE}
ids_to_review=subset(hcdnm, k=5, groups=2)
# recluster
hcdnmr=nhclust(ids_to_review, scoremat=abam)
plot(hcdnmr)
# let's cut at four clusters
hcdnmr.dend=dendextend::color_branches(hcdnmr, k=4, col=rainbow)
dendextend::labels(hcdnmr.dend)=dpn[labels(hcdnmr.dend),'Detail.Page']
par(mar=c(8,5,5,2))
plot(hcdnmr.dend)

# plot in 3d without mirroring 
clear3d()
plot3d(hcdnmr, db=dpn, k=4, soma=8, lwd=2)

# ... and with mirroring
clear3d()
plot3d(hcdnmr, db=dpnm, k=4, soma=8, lwd=2)

# Hmm, mabye let's try k=5

hcdnmr.dend=dendextend::color_branches(hcdnmr, k=5, col=rainbow)
dendextend::labels(hcdnmr.dend)=dpn[labels(hcdnmr.dend),'Detail.Page']
par(mar=c(8,5,5,2))
plot(hcdnmr.dend)

clear3d()
plot3d(hcdnmr, db=dpn, k=5, soma=8, lwd=2)
clear3d()
plot3d(hcdnmr, db=dpnm, k=5, soma=8, lwd=2)
```

So I have a lot of sympathy for the assignments made here, in particular subgroup 1 and 3
```{r subgroups, rgl=TRUE}
clear3d()
plot3d(hcdnmr, db=dpnm, k=5, soma=8, lwd=2, groups = c(1,3))
```

The thing that looks most discordant is that there are a CPU1a type 1/2 seem to be spread out (into groups 1,3,6 when cut at h=0.5). 

Let's review in more detail:
```{r subgroups-detail, rgl=TRUE}
hcdnmr.dend=dendextend::color_branches(hcdnmr, h=0.5, col=rainbow)
dendextend::labels(hcdnmr.dend)=dpn[labels(hcdnmr.dend),'Detail.Page']
par(mar=c(8,5,5,2))
plot(hcdnmr.dend)
```

So looking at those groups 1, 3, 6:
```{r groups-1-3-6, rgl=TRUE}
clear3d()
wire3d(monarch_cc.surf, col='grey', lwd=0.3)
plot3d(hcdnmr, db=dpnm, h=0.5, soma=8, lwd=2, groups = c(1, 3, 6))
```

One can see that magenta neurons CL1b-L7 and CPU1a type1-R7 really are very similar in everything but the lamination of their dendrites in CBU vs CBL.
This actually includes the axon terminal arborisation zones, which look very similar across these 3 plotted subgroups — even for the CL1b-L7 and CPU1a type1-R7.

Conclusion: NBLAST clustering does not reveal all the subtypes according to the same scheme as human anatomists because it uses different invariants (in this case position across the whole neuron favouring staves of the central complex rather than lamination between the ellipsoid body vs fan shaped body.
However the finest subtypes in this final dendrogram to co-cluster, e.g.CPU1a L5/R5/R4mthis suggests to me that if we had rather more data, NBLAST would indeed reliably co-cluster the finest level of cell type in this region.
